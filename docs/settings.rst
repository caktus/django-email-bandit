Settings for django-email-bandit
========================================

These should be in your project ``settings.py``.


``BANDIT_EMAIL``
----------------------------------------

The ``BANDIT_EMAIL`` defines the email address which recieves the hijacked emails.
This defaults to the ``SERVER_EMAIL`` setting if not set::

    BANDIT_EMAIL = 'bandit@example.com'

This option can also be a list to send the hijacked email to multiple addresses::

    BANDIT_EMAIL = ['bandit@example.com', 'accomplice@example.com']


``BANDIT_WHITELIST``
----------------------------------------

By default django-email-bandit will intercept all outgoing emails unless they
are sent to the ``SERVER_EMAIL`` or one of the emails in the ``ADMINS`` setting.
If there are email addresses that should receive mail from your application normally,
add those email addresses to
``BANDIT_WHITELIST``. ``BANDIT_WHITELIST`` defaults to an empty tuple::

    BANDIT_WHITELIST = ('iloveemail@example.com', )

A domain can also be put in the BANDIT_WHITELIST. This will whitelist any email
to that domain::

    BANDIT_WHITELIST = ('example.com', )


``BANDIT_REGEX_WHITELIST``
----------------------------------------

Similar to ``BANDIT_WHITELIST``, but matches whole e-mail address by regular expressions::

    BANDIT_REGEX_WHITELIST = ["ba.*it@bandit\\.com", "joe@.*\\.org"]
